Most maritime analysis tools are generic, one-size-fits-all—limited to what designers anticipated. We're building debrief-calc to be fundamentally context-aware instead.

We're planning analysis tools that adapt to what you're analyzing: tracks, zones, regions. Selecting a track triggers one set of analytical capabilities; analyzing spatial relationships across zones triggers entirely different tools. Every result returns as validated GeoJSON with complete provenance tracking—you always know where insights came from and how they were derived.

The architecture uses decorator-based tool registration, so domain experts can extend analysis capabilities without modifying core systems. It also ships with a CLI for power users and automation workflows.

This ships as part of Future Debrief, our ground-up rebuild of Debrief v4.x—a thick-services, schema-driven platform.
