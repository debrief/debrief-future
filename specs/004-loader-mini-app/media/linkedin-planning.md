# LinkedIn Summary: Loader Mini-App Planning

Your maritime analysis data shouldn't require a PhD to load.

This week we're planning the Loader Mini-App for Future Debrief — a simple desktop wizard that takes a REP file and guides you to the right destination. Two steps: pick a store, configure a plot. Behind the scenes, it orchestrates three services to parse your data, write it to a STAC catalog, and preserve full provenance.

It's Stage 4 of our tracer bullet, the first time all the foundational pieces come together in a real user experience. Deliberately minimal — no map, no analysis yet — just reliable data loading.

We'd love your input on the wizard flow before we build it. Does store-first make sense? What information helps you pick the right plot?
