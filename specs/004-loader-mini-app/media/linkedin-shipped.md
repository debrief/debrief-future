# LinkedIn Post: Loader Mini-App Shipped

---

Data loading shouldn't require a manual.

We just shipped the Loader Mini-App for Future Debrief — a desktop application that turns "I have a maritime data file" into "that data is stored with full provenance" in under 30 seconds.

Right-click a REP file. Pick a store. Name your plot. Done.

Behind the simple wizard, three services coordinate: parsing validates your data, storage organizes it into STAC catalogs, and provenance links every feature back to its source file. First-time users get guided through creating their first store — no config files, no terminal required.

This is Stage 4 of our tracer bullet — the first time users actually interact with the infrastructure we've been building. Electron handles the cross-platform desktop experience, React powers the UI, and Python services do the heavy lifting.

Next: analysis tools (Stage 5) and the VS Code extension (Stage 6).
