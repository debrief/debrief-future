Why STAC for maritime analysis storage?

STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) gives us a well-defined, open standard for organising geospatial data. Every Debrief v4.x plot becomes a STAC Item with GeoJSON features and preserved source files.

This week we're building debrief-stac: create catalogs, add plots, append features, track provenance. All offline-first. All validated against our schema foundation.

The goal is simple: when you load a REP file into Debrief, you'll know exactly where it came from, when it was processed, and that every feature matches the schema.

Full planning details in the blog post.
