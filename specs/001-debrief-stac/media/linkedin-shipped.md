Local STAC catalog operations for Debrief v4.x are live.

Every analysis plot is now a STAC Item. Every track lives in validated GeoJSON. Every source file is preserved with full provenance — when it was loaded, what processed it, where it came from.

STAC turned out to be a natural fit for maritime analysis data. The specification maps cleanly to Debrief's plot concept, and we get interoperability with the broader geospatial ecosystem for free.

The storage backbone is ready. Now we fill it with data.
