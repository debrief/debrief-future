**Shipped: Maritime Analysis Components**

Just completed the React component library for Future Debrief - the next-generation maritime tactical analysis platform.

Three components that work together:
- MapView (Leaflet-based map with track rendering)
- Timeline (Canvas-rendered temporal view)
- FeatureList (Virtualized scrolling list)

Key wins:
- 5 lines of code to display a map with track data
- Synchronized selection across all components
- Automatic theming for VS Code and Electron contexts
- 173 tests, TypeScript strict mode, under 100KB gzipped

Built with React 18, react-leaflet v5, and @tanstack/react-virtual.

These components form the UI foundation for the VS Code extension and Electron app coming next.
