# Backlog — {{ORG}}/{{REPO}}

A bundled dummy dataset shipped with the Backlog Navigator standalone repo.
Renders at the default URL (no query params) so reviewers can exercise
every UI surface — sort, filter, group, description expand, lozenge
rendering, push (dry-run) — without pointing at any real project.

To replace with your own backlog, edit this file and re-deploy.
