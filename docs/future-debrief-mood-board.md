# Future Debrief Mood Board

Visual references and annotations for the maritime professional design direction.

---

## Reference Category 1: UKHO / Admiralty Publications

**Source**: UK Hydrographic Office products and Admiralty design system

**What to take:**
- Authority through restraint — official publications use minimal colour, maximum information density
- Chart-paper cream backgrounds with precise, technical typography
- Information hierarchy through weight and spacing, not colour
- Grid-based layouts echoing chart overlays

**Visual notes:**
- Admiralty charts use a specific cream/buff background (#f5f3ee range) that reduces eye strain during extended use
- Blue is the primary accent — depths, contours, navigational markers
- Text is always functional: coordinates, depths, labels — never decorative
- The "seriousness" comes from precision, not decoration

**Reference URLs:**
- https://www.admiralty.co.uk — note the restrained corporate presentation
- UKHO has an open-source design system: github.com/UKHO/admiralty-design-system

## Reference Category 2: Technical Documentation Sites

**Source**: Stripe Docs, Vercel, Linear

**What to take:**
- Three-column layouts: navigation / content / contextual (code, related links)
- Generous whitespace creating scannable, breathable pages
- Code blocks as first-class citizens with syntax highlighting
- Clear visual hierarchy without heavy decoration

**Stripe Docs specifically:**
- Clean sans-serif typography (they use a custom font similar to Inter)
- White/light backgrounds with subtle depth through shadows
- Purple accent is distinctive but restrained — we use Bearing Blue similarly
- Interactive code samples integrated into prose

**What to avoid:**
- Don't copy the "startup energy" — Stripe's brand is optimistic, ours is operational
- Avoid playful illustrations — their abstract shapes work for payments, not defence

**Reference URLs:**
- https://docs.stripe.com — gold standard for technical documentation
- https://vercel.com/docs — excellent information architecture
- https://linear.app — clean, professional SaaS aesthetic

## Reference Category 3: Operational Displays

**Source**: Sonar waterfall displays, tactical plots, CIC interfaces

**What to take:**
- Time-as-vertical-axis waterfall patterns — could be subtle background textures
- Bearing lines radiating from origin points — decorative element for headers/dividers
- Information density done right — every pixel serves a purpose
- Dark mode aesthetics (for future) — green-on-black, amber-on-dark-blue

**Visual patterns to abstract:**
- **Waterfall gradient**: vertical bands of colour intensity, abstracted as section backgrounds
- **Bearing fans**: thin lines radiating from a point, as decorative header elements
- **Track segments**: dotted/dashed lines with position markers, for visual interest
- **Contour lines**: bathymetric-style curves as subtle background patterns

**Specific references:**
- LOFARgram displays: frequency × time waterfall, distinctive banded appearance
- Broadband sonar: bearing × time, vertical striping pattern
- PPI displays: circular bearing indicators, compass rose elements

**What to avoid:**
- Actual classified interface aesthetics — stay abstracted
- Literal "submarine console" styling — too theme-park
- Green phosphor nostalgia — we're modern, not retro

---

## Reference Category 4: Defence Industry (Modern)

**Source**: BAE Systems, Thales, QinetiQ digital presence

**What to take:**
- Professional restraint — serious without being boring
- Photography of real equipment and operations (when we have it)
- Confidence without hyperbole — let capability speak

**What to avoid:**
- Stock photos of warships at sunset
- Excessive flag-waving nationalism
- Corporate buzzword density
- Glossy marketing sheen

**Note**: Most defence contractor sites are actually bad examples — too much marketing gloss. We want the credibility of the engineering, not the sales department.

---

## Reference Category 5: Data Visualisation

**Source**: Observable, D3 gallery, academic publications

**What to take:**
- Muted, purposeful colour palettes (not rainbow)
- Axis labels, legends, annotations as first-class design elements
- Scientific credibility through precision

**Palette inspiration for charts:**
- Blues for primary data series (matches Bearing Blue)
- Amber for highlights/alerts (matches Signal Amber)
- Greys for context/background data
- Avoid: bright saturated colours, 3D effects, gradients

## Synthesised Direction

### Colour Application

| Element | Colour | Reference |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Page background | Chart Cream #f5f3ee | Admiralty publications |
| Navigation bar | Slate Navy #1e2a3a | Operational displays |
| Links, buttons | Bearing Blue #2d5a7b | Chart depth indicators |
| Highlights | Signal Amber #d4a03c | Warning systems |
| Code blocks | White #ffffff | Stripe docs |
| Borders | Depth 2 #d4d0c7 | Chart grid lines |

### Typography Application

| Element | Style | Reference |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Headings | Inter 600, tight tracking | Stripe docs |
| Body | Inter 400, generous line-height | Technical publications |
| Code | JetBrains Mono | Modern dev tools |
| Labels | Inter 500, all-caps, small | Admiralty chart labels |

### Pattern Library (Abstract Elements)

| Pattern | Use | Source |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Bearing lines | Header decoration, section dividers | Sonar displays |
| Contour bands | Hero backgrounds, card hover states | Bathymetric charts |
| Grid overlay | Code block backgrounds | Chart paper |
| Track dots | Progress indicators, timelines | Tactical plots |

### Photography Direction

When we have imagery:
- Actual Debrief screenshots (the real product)
- Analysis visualisations and plots
- Abstract data patterns from the tool itself
- Never: stock photos, team photos, hardware glamour shots

## Competitive Positioning

| Site | Their Feel | Our Differentiation |
|------|------------|---------------------|
| Legacy debrief.info | Friendly, accessible, dated | Professional, modern, credible |
| ESRI | Corporate GIS, complex | Focused, analyst-first |
| Palantir | Dark, secretive, intimidating | Open, technical, inviting |
| Generic defence | Glossy, marketing-heavy | Substance-first, engineering-led |

## Summary Statement

**Future Debrief should look like:**

The documentation and product site of a serious analysis tool built by people who understand the domain — not a marketing site trying to sell you something.

Think: what DSTL would build if they had a design team with good taste.
